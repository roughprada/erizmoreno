<p><em>Frontiers of  Europe</em> is a series of  publications that explores - through research - the geographic, political and  cultural boundaries of the different territories of the European border; with a  specific focus on the territories with a culture not well known to the majority  of the inhabitants in Western Europe. </p>

<p>The publication is a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the culture and society of the  territories chosen at a given time, each journal consists of a collection of  material both taken by the authors and obtained after researching files and/or  interviews with key people in the contemporary cultural scene of each territory  (with a special interest in the visual arts, politics and society), due to  their role as &ldquo;seismographs&rdquo; and representatives of the reflective observation  of society and creative thinking. </p>
	
<p>The approach to each place is done without wanting to establish an external  vision to it, but with the intention of collecting local perspectives through  meetings and interviews. From these connections, the objective of each  publication is to describe a deeper perspective by documenting each of the  participants&rsquo; experiences through the inputs they contribute (images, texts and  objects). In this sense, the interviews are the best way to get an idea of the  background, the perspective, and hopes and dreams the people of these countries  have and share, as well as the understanding of how they see Europe and the  relations with their identity. </p>
	
<p>The magazine series, created by the artist Eriz Moreno Aranguren and the art communicator Constanze  Müller. It offers an artistic approach leading to a deeper understanding of the  internal perspective of territories on the borders of Europe.</p>
	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
<p>#Armenia / ISBN: 978-84-606-9025-2</p>
	
<p>The initial  point of #ARMENIA is formed by its cultural and political conflicts as well as the  unclear geographical situation   and the Armenian mixed culture with European and Asian influences forms the Armenian culture as an  &ldquo;culture-in-between&rdquo;. This hybrid make-up is supported by the fact that the Armenian  culture is also influenced by its diaspora. Like this, the question of the nation&rsquo;s identity  confidence has an interesting point to discover.</p>
	
<p>Starting  from a Western-European perspective, Armenia above all is more known for the  Genocide than for its social-cultural development of the last 100 years. In the  Western-European stereotypical perspective it is often classified as an  adventurous and secret country. The mountainous scenery, the conflict about  Mount Ararat and Nagorno Karabakh and the smallness of the state territory  contribute to this rather dramatic transfiguration. Our research focused on the  questions, how Armenians see themselves, and how they see Europe. </p>
	
<p>The current  identity conflict also comes from the fact that, as a former&nbsp;Soviet  Socialist Republic, the influence of Russia is still strong in politics and  society, even if the attempts for independence from 1991 officially allow an  autonomous policy of alliances to Western partners. On account of its democracy aspiration and  its Christian heritage, Armenia gets on to a Europe-turned society. In this respect, from  June 2010 negotiations to assimilate Armenia to the &ldquo;Eastern Partnership&rdquo; were begun within the  EU and the Armenian government. Nevertheless since Armenia&rsquo;s stronger approach  to its old partner Russia, culminating in a gas supply agreement with Russia in  December 2013, which approximated the country to the Eurasian Customs Union, these negotiation  are nowadays considered as a nearly frozen process.</p>
	
<p>To start the discussions on the  field of current identity and cultural constructions of Armenia, the research started with three thematic workshops where the participants  – Lala Alikyan (activist),  Art Laboratory (artistic  group), Susanna Gyulamiryan (art critic, curator),&nbsp;Vahram Jaloyan  (cultural critic), Arevik Martirosyan (sociologist, activist), Varham  Martirvosyan (writer), Vahram Soghmoyan (political scientist), Hasmik Amiraghyan (philologist, translator) – gave short presentations about&nbsp;their perception of European influences in Armenian history, about the  make-up of Armenian culture and the current political situation. The presenters also created maps, visual  representations of the connections between different concepts or their ideas.  In the end, the participants in the workshops felt constrained by the group format  of these discussions, so the working way transitioned to one-on-one interviews. These conversations were far  more intense, and the interviewees were very articulate discussing Armenian  culture and how they felt as Armenian individuals, citizens and artists. One of  the participants even created a piece of art that followed the interview. </p>
	
<p>The publication shows a choice  of three interviews with the artists Karen Alekyan and Ara Petrosyan and the  political scientist Vahram Soghmoyan. Both artists have very interesting career trajectories – both coming from  classical academic painting, who transformed their artistic working way into  contemporary artistic practices of performance, video art and participative  art– genres of art, which are underrepresented in the Armenian contemporary  art.</p>
	
<p>-  Karen Alekyan  speaks about his difficult role as artist in the Armenian society, his relation  to the Armenian state and his wishes for the future. In this interview he  created the idea to his video work &ldquo;Maps of the Future&rdquo; (2014), where he  describes his visions on a global society.<br />
  - Ara Petrosyan, politically  very active as well, explains critically the life conditions of an Armenian  artist and the Armenian art system.<br />
  - Vahram Soghmoyan  compares the political situations of Armenia with Western Europe from the background  that he graduated in Germany and is very much involved in many citizen`s  initiatives in Yerevan who fight against the government for more participation  in political processes.</p>
	
<p>In addition, the magazine  includes texts, which give diverse  perspectives from different sectors of society like from Hakob Matevosyan about the Armenian diaspora, Terry Eagleton about  the role of football in the society and a responding article by Dave Zirin,  from Wolfgang Kaschuba about the relation between politics and identity in  Armenia, and from Angela Harutyunyan about the curator`s role in Armenia.</p>
	
<p>The first  publication of the FRONTIERS OF EUROPE project is based on a research during a  residence from 15th January to 17th of June 2014 at the  &ldquo;Art and Cultural Studies Laboratory&rdquo; in Yerevan, Armenia.<br />
