<p><strong>The triumph of Reason</strong></p>

<p><strong>4th July, 1943 – 23th August, 1943<br />
  <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.720648,36.199608&amp;spn=0.152496,0.363579&amp;t=h&amp;z=12" target="_blank">51°43&rsquo; N - 36°11&rsquo; E</a></strong></p>

<p>The summer of 1943 put the<em> OKW </em>before a difficult decision, as a result of resigning from a response operation (for economical reasons) emerged  the idea of the <em> Unternehmen Zitadelle</em>: to attack the enemy Kursk protrusion, which would be isolated through a double concentrical attack.</p>
<p>The  success  was  supposed  to  be  achieved  thanks  to  an  operation  of <em>Blitzkrieg</em> type: but due to a two-month delay of the offensive, e.g. of the  supply of the promised new, but not determining, <em> Panzerkampfwagen V Panther</em>, with the foresight made by the <em>Ставка </em>who detected the concentration  of <em> Panzerdivisionen </em>and  motorized  infantry  units  on  the  North  and  South  of  the  protrusion,  strengthened  by  the  reports  of  the  agent <em>Lucy </em>who had access to the discussions of the<em> OKW </em>(and who communicated the<em> D-day</em>), the enemy had enough time to organize the battlefield  where they expected to be attacked, and fortify it from 25 to 40 kilometers deep.</p>
<p>At dusk on July 4th, a sapper from the <em> 9. Armee </em>got to the enemy and  communicated the final <em> H-hour</em>.</p>
<p>However,  even  facing  the  lack  of  the  element  of  surprise  and/or  of  sufficient forces, the beginning of the operation was successful at the  start; but the <em> OKH </em>would cut it clean and conclude by deciding to abandon the operation without fulfilling the objective of &ldquo;pinching&rdquo; the enemy  in August, not as much pressured by the local situation, or the triggered  offensive against the protrusion of Orel, but rather forced by the situation  on Sicilia, which was already noticeable at the beginning of the summer  of that year.</p>
<p>After their withdrawal, the initiative completely changed side, as the  number of casualties gave the enemy a strategic advantage which would  persist until the end of the conflict.</p>

<p>Laid  down  March  22,  1992;  launched  May  16,  1994;  the  K-141  was  commissioned  on  30th  December  1994,  being  the  penultimate  of  the <em>Project 949A «Антей» </em>class that was to become part of the<em> Северный  флот </em>of the Russian Navy; due to economic cuts, the Fleet remained anchored in the Andreyeva Bay since the fall of the Soviet Union. However,  Russia´s recovery from the economic depression at the end of the 1990&rsquo;s  led to the revival of the Fleet: in 1999 Kursk successfully accomplished a  reconnaissance mission concerning the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea during the Kosovo War.</p>
During  the  naval  exercises  on  12th  August  2000, a  leakage  of  H2O2 in the practice torpedo, which was supposed to be launched against the  vessel <em>Пётр Великий</em>, penetrated a poor welding and reacted with oxide  in the torpedo tube; the pressure smashed the torpedo (7:28 UTC), releasing the fuel it carried. The torpedo door was ill-fitted, the explosion  killed the torpedo cabin crew and the blast spread through the air vent,  which was the same as that of an office, reaching the command centre  and badly burning the sailors inside of it. The fire that broke out as a  result, damaged twenty one of the stored torpedoes, making six of them  explode (7:30 UTC) and destroy the bow of the ship.
<p>The  initial  attempt  of  keeping  the  tragedy  secret  has  failed  since,  as  due to the pressure from the relatives of the crew, the Russian Navy was  forced to request aid in order to rescue the survivors.</p>
<p>Following  the  order  of  the  Kremlin,  the  Government  assigned  160  million  dollars  for  the  rescue  operation:  the  bulk  of  the  Navy&rsquo;s  annual  budget.</p>
<p>The practice torpedo had never undergone any control, as it did not  possess any nuclear warhead. </p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I am writing blindly.The time is 13:15.All personnel from sections six,seven and eight  have moved to section nine. There are 23 people here. We made this decision because  none of us can escape. It is too dark to write here, but I will try. It looks like we have  no chance, maybe 10-20 percent. I hope that someday someone will read this. Do not  despair.&rdquo;</em></p>
